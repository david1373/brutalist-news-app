# Development Status - December 21, 2024

## Current Progress
- Successfully set up PostgreSQL database structure
- Migrations ran successfully: "Batch 1 completed: [ '20241221_create_articles.js' ]"
- Pushed scraping service files to GitHub (but having sync issues)
- Currently working on resolving merge conflicts

## Current Branch State
- On branch: `fix/database-setup`
- Behind origin/fix/database-setup by 1 commit
- Have unmerged paths that need resolution

## Unresolved Merge Conflicts
1. `database/migrations/20241221_create_articles.js` (both added)
2. `package-lock.json` (both modified)
3. `package.json` (both modified)
4. `scripts/migrate.js` (both added)

## Files Successfully Modified/Added
- `database/knexfile.js` (modified)
- `scripts/scrape.js` (new file)
- `services/scrapers/dezeen.js` (new file)
- `src/components/ui/card.jsx` (modified)

## Next Steps
1. Resolve merge conflicts for:
   - Migration file
   - Package files
   - Migration script
2. Test scraping functionality
3. Implement Leibal scraper
4. Set up API endpoints

## Recent Code Changes

### Updated knexfile.js Configuration
```javascript
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';
import { dirname, join } from 'path';
import 'dotenv/config';

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = dirname(__filename);

const development = {
  client: 'pg',
  connection: {
    host: process.env.DB_HOST || 'localhost',
    port: process.env.DB_PORT || 5432,
    database: process.env.DB_NAME || 'brutalist_dev',
    user: process.env.DB_USER || (process.platform === 'darwin' ? process.env.USER : 'postgres'),
  },
  migrations: {
    directory: join(__dirname, 'migrations'),
  },
  seeds: {
    directory: join(__dirname, 'seeds'),
  },
  debug: true
};

const production = {
  client: 'pg',
  connection: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  migrations: {
    directory: join(__dirname, 'migrations'),
  },
  seeds: {
    directory: join(__dirname, 'seeds'),
  },
  pool: {
    min: 2,
    max: 10,
  },
};

const config = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? production : development;

export default config;
```

## Git Status
```bash
On branch fix/database-setup
Your branch is behind 'origin/fix/database-setup' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
  (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)
```

## Next Actions Needed
1. View and resolve conflicts in:
   ```bash
   cat database/migrations/20241221_create_articles.js
   git diff package.json
   cat scripts/migrate.js
   ```
2. Resolve each conflict maintaining correct functionality
3. Complete the merge
4. Test the scraping system

## Note for Next Session
When starting the next session, we'll need to:
1. Review these merge conflicts
2. Resolve them systematically
3. Ensure all files are properly synced between local and remote
4. Test the scraping functionality
